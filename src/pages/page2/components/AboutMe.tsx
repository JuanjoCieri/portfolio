        Full-Stack Developer with Front-end orientation. I am a person with the
        ability to easily adapt to any environment. I like to face problems to
        propose creative and efficient solutions. I love working in a team to
        have different points of view and propose ideas to reach a common good.
        <br/>
        I am a very organized person. I like to have everything well documented
        and separated by parts, that's why in most of my projects I use React
        (Clean Architecture).
